# Attraktors Designer
Create, Design and Play Strange Attraktors in TouchDesigner

ATTRAKTORs DESIGNER is an application created with TouchDesigner from Derivative.
It can play with the different equations of strange attractors or others, mix and control them with different parameters in order to modify the movement of particles by creating random and aesthetically coherent shapes.

All design is created in real time into the app in 3D. The parameters of the particle system are controlled by the audio and the shapes obtained self-regenerate according to the settings chosen. Real-time intervention by controllers is possible to play with these forms which make one think of choreography of particles dancing shapes.
